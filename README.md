# javascript-drumkit

 Keyboard drumkit powered by JavaScript - built by Seth Feingold.

 This project is part of #JavaScript30 from Wes Bos - a list of 30 JavaScript projects aimed to help programmers improve their vanilla JS/ES6 skills.

 This project was really fun! It game me practice playing embedded audio files - something I've never done before. Being able to assign the 'currentTime' to 0 was a simple and incredibly useful way to improve the functionality and performance of the sound cues. Without it, the sound cues would need to play entirely through before any other sounds could be played.

 Previous JavaScript projects gave me experience applying "click" event listeners to page elements, but this project allowed me to get more comfortable capturing key presses from the user by learning about 'event.keyCode' and how to access this property's value.

 Aside from playing audio files and capturing user key presses, this project also improved my skills applying temporary styling classes to elements on the web page.
